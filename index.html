          <h3>A Short Introduction</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              Hello! I'm Will, a computer science student and aspiring software
              developer. I enjoy solving problems and learning new things. I'm
              adaptable and have made projects in a variety of languges,
              including object-oriented languages such as C#. I also have
              experience with the Godot and Unity Game Engines.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, I'm pursuing a BS in Computer Science at UC Irvine,
              with estimated graduation in Spring 2027. Some notable topics I
              have studied include Search and Sort Algorithms, Data Structures,
              and Object Oriented Programming in C++.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my free time, I like to spend time with friends and play
              videogames. I enjoy a wide variety of games. My favorites tend to
              be games that make me think or give me fun new experiences with my
              friends. Additionally, I enjoy making games, and am currently
              working on
              <em>Tower of Genn</em> (more details below).
