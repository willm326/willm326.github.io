    <h1>Tower of Genn</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Tower of Genn is a student project that I made with other UC Irvine
      students. It is currently still in development, with plans for a steam
      release early next year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general premise of the game is to place blocks strategically to build
      your tower as high as possible while maintaining your tower's stability.
      As the player gets higher, they are presented with hazards and challenges
      threatening the stability of their tower.
    </p>
