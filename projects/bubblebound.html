    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Tower of Genn is a student project that I made with other UC Irvine
      students. It is currently still in development, with plans for a steam
      release early next year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general premise of the game is to place blocks strategically to build
      your tower as high as possible while maintaining your tower's stability.
      As the player gets higher, they are presented with hazards and challenges
      threatening the stability of their tower.
    </p>

    <h2>Responsibilites</h2>
    <p>I was the programming lead on this project, responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Organizing and Running Programmer Meetings</li>
      <li>Assigning and Managing Programmer Tasks on Trello</li>
      <li>Managing the Github Repository</li>
      <li>General Bug Fixing</li>
      <li>Code Review</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Additionally, I implemented the interactable object system, one of the
      game's core systems. This involved me creating a customizable component,
      which other programmers and I could use to add to objects in the engine to
      make them interactable.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>
      This is the first game I made using the Godot game engine and gdscript.
      This required me to spend a lot of time at the start of the project
      learning the basics of the engine and how it differs from Unity (a
      different game engine I'm familiar with). I made extensive use of Godot's
      documentation to help understand any new concepts and read about
      unfamiliar classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another challenge I had was managing the team. The team was mostly formed
      of novice coders. Outside of myself, the team consisted of one freshman,
      one sophmore, and two high school students. There were varying levels of
      coding experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      My job was to take the requests from the design team and break them up
      into tasks for the coders. I then had to assign the tasks to different
      members of the teams, based on their coding strenghts and effiency. This
      included prioritizing tasks to ensure that important tasks would be
      completed early and shared with the design team.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this experience, I learned the importance of understanding your team,
      and how to effectively create and distribute tasks.
    </p>

      The GitHub for this project is a private repository. However, I have
      included some of the code I worked on here:
