      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Bubblebound is a student project that I made with other UC Irvine
        students in 2024. It was made in a team of around 14 people using the
        Godot Engine and gdscript in around 8 weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bubblebound is a puzzle based adventure game, where the player utilizes
        different types of fish to complete puzzles. There are two types of
        fish: fire and ice, which can each interact with specific objects in the
        environment. For example, ice fish can freeze moving objects, and fire
        fish can melt ice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game was released on
        <a href="https://minjikim0915.itch.io/bubblebound" target="_blank">
          itch.io</a
        >
        in December 2024.
      </p>

      <h3>Responsibilites</h3>
      <p>I was the programming lead on this project, responsible for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Organizing and Running Programmer Meetings</li>
        <li>Assigning and Managing Programmer Tasks on Trello</li>
        <li>Managing the Github Repository</li>
        <li>General Bug Fixing</li>
        <li>Code Review</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Additionally, I implemented the interactable object system, one of the
        game's core systems. This involved me creating a customizable component,
        which other programmers and I could use to add to objects in the engine
        to make them interactable.
      </p>

      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        This is the first game I made using the Godot game engine and gdscript.
        This required me to spend a lot of time at the start of the project
        learning the basics of the engine and how it differs from Unity (a
        different game engine I'm familiar with). I made extensive use of
        Godot's documentation to help understand any new concepts and read about
        unfamiliar classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another challenge I had was managing the team. The team was mostly
        formed of novice coders. Outside of myself, the team consisted of one
        freshman, one sophmore, and two high school students. There were varying
        levels of coding experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        My job was to take the requests from the design team and break them up
        into tasks for the coders. I then had to assign the tasks to different
        members of the teams, based on their coding strenghts and effiency. This
        included prioritizing tasks to ensure that important tasks would be
        completed early and shared with the design team.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this experience, I learned the importance of understanding your
        team, and how to effectively create and distribute tasks.
      </p>

      <h3>Code Samples and Development Pictures</h3>
      <p>
        The GitHub for this project is a private repository. However, I have
        included some of the code I worked on here:
      </p>
      <div class="button-group">
        <div>
          <input
            type="radio"
            class="script-select"
            name="scripts"
            id="interactable.gd"
            value="bubblebound/interactable.html"
            checked
          />
          <label class="tile radio-button" for="interactable.gd"
            >interactable.gd</label
          >
        </div>
        <div>
          <input
            type="radio"
            class="script-select"
            name="scripts"
            id="ice_wall.gd"
            value="bubblebound/ice-wall.html"
          />
          <label class="tile radio-button" for="ice_wall.gd">
            ice_wall.gd
          </label>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="sample">
        <iframe
          title="Code Sample"
          src="../sample-code/bubblebound/interactable.html"
        ></iframe>
        <div class="tile interactable.gd caption">
          <p>
            This is the script for the <strong>Interactable</strong> class. This
            is a base class that in game interactable objects can extend or add
            as a child component. It establishes an interface for detecting
            player mouse movement and interacting with the object using fish.
          </p>
          <p>
            I designed it to allow other developers to be able to create
            interactable objects from within the Godot Editor, without having to
            write scripts for handling player interaction.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tile ice_wall.gd caption" style="display: none">
          <p>
            This is the script for the <strong>Ice Wall</strong> game object. It
            utilizes <code>Interactable</code> as a child component.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>_on_engage</code> and <code>_on_disengage</code> functions
            listen for signals emitted by the
            <code>Interactable</code> component to grow and shrink the ice when
            a fish interacts with the object.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason this code listens to signals instead of inheriting
            Interactable and overloading <code>_engage_fish</code> and
            <code>disengage_fish</code> is so that it can instead extend
            <code>StaticBody2D</code> (Godot only allows inheritance from one
            parent class).
