      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Tower of Genn is a student project that I made with other UC Irvine
        students. It is currently still in development, with plans for a steam
        release early next year.
      </p>
      <p>
        The general premise of the game is to place blocks strategically to
        build your tower as high as possible while maintaining your tower's
        stability. As the player gets higher, they are presented with hazards
        and challenges threatening the stability of their tower.
      </p>

      <h3>Responsibilites</h3>
      <p>I was the programming lead on this project, responsible for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Organizing and Running Weekly Programmer Meetings</li>
        <li>Assigning Tasks to Programmers</li>
        <li>Managing the Github Repository</li>
        <li>Code Review</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additionally, I implemented a couple game features, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Camera and Camera Controls</li>
        <li>Side Objective System</li>
        <li>Piece Placement Preview</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        This is the first 3D video game that I have programmed. I have worked in
        3D engines like Unity before, but only to create sprite based 2D games.
      </p>
      <p>
        While working on Tower of Genn, I had to adjust to having an extra axis.
        This caused me some extra challenges when implementing the camera
        controls. Since the player is free to rotate the camera a full 360
        degrees, the forward direction of the camera changes. This means that
        the controls have to account for the rotation of the camera to move the
        piece in the proper direction.
      </p>

      <h3>Code Samples and Development Pictures</h3>
      <p>
        The GitHub for this project is a private repository. However, I have
        included some of the code I worked on here:

          This is the script for the <strong>Objective</strong> class. This is a
          base class that in game objectives extend. It has two functions that
          can be overriden, both being called automatically by ObjectiveManager
          when they receive signals from other game systems.
        </p>
        <p class="tile drum_controller.ino caption" style="display: none">
          This is the script for the <strong>Objective Data</strong> class. This
          is a base resource class storing pieces of data that all instances of
          the corresponding objective share. The <code>@export</code> keyword
          allows the resource to be edited in the Godot editor to make it easy
          for designers and programmers to edit objective values.
